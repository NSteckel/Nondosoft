# This is the repository for one of the websites I made for my senior comps project. 
The live version of the website can be found at: https://nsteckel.github.io/Nondosoft/ 
The rest of the files needed to run the game and document its process will be in a separate repository at: https://github.com/NSteckel/Senior-Comps
